I created this site using HTML and CSS. While developing the project, I learned how to use divs in HTML, how to create lists, how to use section elements, and how to use class and id properties. I also added hover effects with CSS to give the site a modern look. I also learned a lot of things like interacting with buttons and using the media screen feature to adjust how the site looks on different devices (phone, tablet, computer).
